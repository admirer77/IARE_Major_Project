It is included as a baseline for comparison with attack traffic.\n","\n","Impact: None, as this is regular, safe traffic.\n","\n","# LDAP:\n","\n","Description: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is used for accessing and managing directory information. DDoS attacks targeting LDAP servers can involve sending a high volume of requests to the server, overwhelming it and causing service disruption.\n","\n","Impact: Disruption of services that rely on directory access, leading to possible unavailability of authentication and resource location services.\n","\n","# MSSQL:\n","\n","Description: Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is a relational database management system. DDoS attacks on MSSQL servers typically involve sending massive amounts of SQL queries or connection requests, which can overwhelm the database server.\n","\n","Impact: The database server may become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for applications that rely on the database.\n","\n","# Portmap:\n","\n","Description: Portmap (also known as RPCBIND) is a service that maps RPC (Remote Procedure Call) program numbers to network port numbers. A Portmap DDoS attack involves sending a high volume of RPC requests, overwhelming the server.\n","\n","Impact: This can lead to a denial of service for any applications or services relying on RPC communication.\n","\n","# Syn:\n","\n","Description: A SYN flood is a type of DDoS attack where the attacker sends a large number of SYN (synchronization) requests to a target's system. These requests initiate a TCP connection but the handshake is never completed, leaving the server with half-open connections and eventually exhausting its resources.\n","\n","Impact: This can cause the target server to become unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from establishing connections.\n","\n","# UDP:\n","\n","Description: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) flood attacks involve sending a large number of UDP packets to random ports on a target server. The server must process and respond to each packet, which can overwhelm it.\n","\n","Impact: The server may become overwhelmed with the number of requests, leading to service disruption or unavailability.\n","\n","# UDPLag:\n","\n","Description: A UDPLag attack is a variant of the UDP flood, where the attacker sends a large volume of UDP packets specifically designed to cause latency in the target system's response. This can increase lag and delay in network communications.\n","\n","Impact: This can lead to significant delays in network services, reducing performance and potentially causing service outages."],"metadata":{"id":"usS57YIMtaND"}}]}
